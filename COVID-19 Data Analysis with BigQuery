COVID-19 Data Analysis: Comparing Recovered Cases and Active Cases
Project Overview:
This project analyzes COVID-19 data from the bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary dataset to compare 
recovered cases and average active cases across selected countries.

Key Findings:
•	Spain reported the highest number of recovered cases.
•	Mexico had a lower average number of active cases compared to Spain and the United States.

Data Analysis:

SQL Query:
SELECT
  summary.recovered,
  AVG(summary.active) AS Average_score
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary` AS summary
WHERE summary.country_region IN ('Spain', 'Mexico', 'Columbia', 'United States')
  AND summary.recovered IS NOT NULL
  AND summary.active IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1;


Explanation:
•	Filters the data for the specified countries.
•	Calculates the average active cases for each recovered case count.
•	Handles null values to ensure accurate results.


Results:
Recovered Cases	Average Active Cases
7070616437	...
3944062935	...
...	...


Future Work:
•	Expand Analysis: Explore additional metrics like mortality rates and hospitalization rates.
•	Time Series Analysis: Analyze data over time to identify trends and patterns.
•	Geographic Visualization: Create maps to visualize the spatial distribution of cases.
